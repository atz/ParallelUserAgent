SSL SUPPORT
-----------

If you enabled your libwww-perl package to support SSL/TLSv1 with its HTTP client
and server classes, you can readily access HTTPS sites with ParallelUA as well.

Please refer to README.SSL in the libwww-perl distribution for further
information on how to enable SSL support in libwww-perl (and therefor in
ParallelUA).
