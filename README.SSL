SSL SUPPORT
-----------

 ** DISCLAIMER: https support is pretty buggy as of now. i haven't **
 ** had time to test much of it, so feel free to see if it works   **
 ** for you, but don't expect it to :-)                            **

If you enabled your libwww-perl package to support SSL/TLSv1 with its
HTTP client and server classes, you can readily access HTTPS sites
with ParallelUA as well.

Please refer to README.SSL in the libwww-perl distribution for further
information on how to enable SSL support in libwww-perl (and therefor
in ParallelUA).
